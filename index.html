          Her theories questioned some traditional Freudian views. This was
          particularly true of her theories of sexuality and of the instinct
          orientation of psychoanalysis.

          Karen Horney was a German psychoanalyst who practiced in the United
          States during her later career. Her theories questioned some
          traditional Freudian views. This was particularly true of her theories
          of sexuality and of the instinct orientation of psychoanalysis. She is
          credited with founding feminist psychology in response to Freud's
          theory of penis envy. She disagreed with Freud about inherent
          differences in the psychology of men and women, and she traced such
          differences to society and culture rather than biology. As such, she
          is often classified as neo-Freudian.

          Horney was also a pioneer in the discipline of feminine psychiatry. As
          one of the first female psychiatrists, she was the first known woman
          to present a paper regarding feminine psychiatry. As a woman, she felt
          that the mapping out of trends in female behaviour was a neglected
          issue. In her essay entitled "The Problem of Feminine Masochism",
          Horney felt she proved that cultures and societies worldwide
          encouraged women to be dependent on men for their love, prestige,
          wealth, care and protection. She pointed out that in the society, a
          will to please, satiate and overvalue men had emerged. Women were
          regarded as objects of charm and beauty—at variance with every human
          being's ultimate purpose of self-actualization.

          The Karen Horney Clinic opened on May 6, 1955 in New York City, in
          honor of Horney's achievements. The institution seeks to research and
          train medical professionals, particularly in the psychiatric fields,
          as well as serving as a low-cost treatment center. The Clinic has
          recently witnessed an increase of patients not suitable for
          psychoanalysis for different reasons. These patients are treated with
          psychotherapeutic modalities such as supportive psychotherapy, and
          psychoanalytic psychotherapy, all based on Horney's ideas.
